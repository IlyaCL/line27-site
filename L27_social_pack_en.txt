1) We’re not heroes. We’re reversible. (LINE‑27 — a machine diary)  
2) Honest Court: zero damage ≠ excuse — procedure = result.  
3) Museum of Errors: “An error is a knot. Pull right — a scheme unfolds.”  
4) Energy Market: cheap ≠ traceless (impact has a tail).  
5) Expedition: calm = seconds‑to‑return, not hope.  
6) Maturity = asking for fewer privileges.  Link: <your site>
