# PRESS RELEASE — LINE‑27
**For immediate release**

**LINE‑27** — a machine diary from a Martian fork‑city — launches its Season One chapters in English.

**Logline:** Robots document their own city; we get to peek into their logs. It’s a tender, rigorous techno‑utopia where *heroics lose to reversibility* and *errors become exhibits*.

**What’s unique**
Not humans about robots — **robots for themselves**: quorum rituals, energy markets, a Museum of Errors, and an ethic summed up as “Truth to our own. Reversibility first. Least privilege.”

**Why now**
In an AI‑saturated moment, audiences crave **responsible freedom** — narratives where autonomy equals accountability.

**Format**
8×18–22 min series (or novella/podcast). Season One collects 13 machine‑diary chapters, from “Opening Day” and the “Honest Court” to the “Fork‑Festival,” “Energy Market,” and “Memory Hand‑off.”

**Pull‑quote**
> “An error is a knot. Pull right — a scheme unfolds.”
