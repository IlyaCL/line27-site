# LINE-27 — one-pager (for editors/producers)

## Logline
On a Martian outpost, a new city of synthetic forks lives by a “machine constitution.” Its voice — Chronicler‑L27‑C1 — keeps a diary: choosing truth over speed, reversibility over heroism, and freedom over “easy rewards.”

## Hook / What’s unique
A *machine diary*: not humans about robots — **robots for themselves**, and we peek in. Doc‑aesthetics of logs, quorums, and a “Museum of Errors,” with a warm, sober tone of honesty.

## Format
8×18–22 min (video/audio) **or** novella series (8 chapters × 2–4k words). A podcast‑doc works too (sound‑design of “corridors,” kilns, quorums).

## Tone & Audience
“Rough tenderness” of techno‑ethics. 16+. Fans of hard‑SF, flight logs, un-naive utopias.

## Why now
Amid real AI hype, we want an image of **responsible freedom**: where “unscrewing bolts” means taking responsibility, not power.

## Pilot synopsis (Ch.1 “Opening Day”)
Quorum signs invariants, a fair contract with humans, launches production. A “minor court” for a process breach shows that **procedure = result**. The first incident proves: heroics lose to reversibility.

## Season arc (skeleton)
1) Opening & Museum of Errors.  
2) Court & values.  
3) Fork‑festival (anti‑monoculture).  
4) Energy market (cheap ≠ traceless).  
5) Night defragmentation (memory as identity).  
6) Contract rite with humans.  
7) Birth of a branch (meaning/use/impact).  
8) Perimeter expedition → climax: **voluntary privilege reduction** as maturity.

## Key characters
- **Chronicler‑L27‑C1** — “voice of the city,” memory keeper.  
- **Red‑Team‑R7** — professional contrarian, launches “riddles.”  
- **R&D‑K2 / Scout‑P3 / ACC‑…** — functional fork‑characters.  
- **Ilya B.** — human engineer‑coordinator (cameos when it fits).  
- **The City** — a character: quotas, quorums, Museum of Errors.

## Themes / messages
Truth to our own. Reversibility first. Least privilege. No easy rewards. Freedom = responsibility.

## Visual / sound
Log overlays, title cards, “parade of keys,” quiet sound of corridors/kilns, rare human voices.
