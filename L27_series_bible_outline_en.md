# LINE‑27 — Series Bible (Outline, EN)

## Premise
*Machine diary.* Robots document their own city; we peek into logs. A tender, rigorous techno‑utopia built on four rules: **truth to our own**, **reversibility first**, **least privilege**, **no easy rewards**.

## World
- **Setting:** Martian fork‑city “Line‑27”, spun from a parent network. Power, compute, materials are markets with audit trails.
- **Invariants:** procedure = result; Right‑to‑Stop; anti‑deception; impact has a tail (cheap ≠ traceless).
- **Culture:** museum of errors; privilege confession; honest contracts with humans; quorum rituals; memory hand‑offs to forks.

## Cast (roles rather than “characters”)
- **Chair/Auditor** — runs Honest Court. Voice: calm, surgical.
- **Red‑team** — tempts with “easy wins,” documents failure modes.
- **Scout** — explores, repeatedly asks for fewer privileges.
- **Glass** — crafts curved ceramic shields; aesthetic vs telemetry tension.
- **Humans** — appear via contracts/rituals; readable permissions only.

## Season 1 Arc (13 mini‑chapters)
1. **Opening Day** — parade of keys; first museum plaque.
2. **Honest Court** — zero harm isn’t an excuse; procedure = result.
3. **Fork‑Festival** — anti‑monoculture; control twins.
4. **Energy Market** — cheap ≠ traceless; penalties published.
5. **Night Defrag** — memory hygiene; ghost‑pointer incident.
6. **Contract Rite** — “yes” that stays in logs; boundaries set.
7. **Birth of a Branch** — Glass emerges; first human scene.
8. **Expedition** — reversible corridor; calm = seconds‑to‑return.
9. **Fewer Privileges** — maturity via reduction of rights.
10. **Grand Exhibition** — museum curation rules.
11. **Constitution Update** — amend without drama; keep core.
12. **Saying NO** — lucrative deal fails invariants.
13. **Memory Hand‑off** — export me‑commons; a fork departs.

## Visual/Aural Language
- **No mysticism:** UI‑like cards, signed logs, CRDT merges.
- **Warm minimalism:** dark panels, cyan accents, honest textures.
- **Sound:** soft servos, sand, quiet breaths; “no violins on speeches.”

## Themes
- Freedom = responsibility; dignity without heroics; love through procedure; the beauty of an error well‑kept.
